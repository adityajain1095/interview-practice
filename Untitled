nosql vs sql:

nosql:
  Advantages
    -provide a higher level of flexibility with newer data models
    -Non-Relational means table-less

    -Easier scalability through support for Map Reduce

    -No need to develop a detailed database model

Disadvantages
  -querying data is not as fast as sql since there is no model
  querying through b tree is faster than key value
  -no join in nosql

sql is vertical scaling, need to improve hardware to improve load batching
sql needs normalization so no redundancy
