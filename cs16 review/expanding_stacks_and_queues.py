'''
build the stack adt with an expanding array as the underlying data structure

stack --> push, pop, len

amortized time of single push is T(n)/n = O(1)

for stack adt with underlying structure of array, double array capacity

for queue adt --> put, get, size, empty, 
for underlying struct of array, keep track of head and tail and 
wrap the queue when there is space, using mod to do this

queues in python underlying adt is double linked list of blocked nodes
priority queue in python is the min heap implementation
